# Param Component Style Folder

In ROS2 Foxy there is a bug with component node parameter loading where the standard nested parameter style is incompatible.
See here (https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros/issues/156)

This folder serves as a duplicate of the upper param folder but with corrected parameter files to support this alternative file pattern.
